# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the API PrestaShop integration project for KOAJ e-commerce. This repository is designed to facilitate integration between KOAJ's e-commerce systems and the PrestaShop platform.

**Current Status**: This is a newly initialized repository with minimal codebase. The project structure and development commands will be added as the codebase grows.

## Development Commands

Since this repository is newly created, specific build/test/lint commands have not yet been established. Commands will be documented here as the project develops and build tools are added.

## Architecture

**Current Architecture**: Not yet established - this is a fresh repository.

The architecture and code structure will be documented here as development progresses and the codebase evolves.

## Git Workflow

This repository is configured with:
- **Remote**: https://github.com/neeroai/api_prestashop.git
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Authentication**: GitHub CLI configured for user neeroai

## Future Development

As this codebase grows, this file should be updated to include:
- Specific build/test/deployment commands
- API architecture and integration patterns
- PrestaShop-specific configuration and setup
- Environment configuration requirements
- Testing frameworks and patterns used
